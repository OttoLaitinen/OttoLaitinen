# Hello there! I am Otto 👋🏻

In short, I design and develop software products. Currently working as a Software Engineer @mindlercare.

I'm also a master's student at Aalto University majoring in Human-Computer Interaction. I enjoy creating and building things that people use, experience and interact with.
